# üåïMoonTimers API

This is the backend code for [üåïMoonTimers](https://moontimers.com)

### Vercel Serverless Functions

All API calls are deployed as [serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/introduction) on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

### Prerequisites

[Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) installed for local development
MongoDB instance and a connection string - [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) offers a free tier plan
The collection names I use for the app are:

- **categories** (the navigation categories)
- **moon_icons** (the different moon emojis used on the timers)
- **timer_types** (count-downs, count-ups)
- **gme_data** (market data from Yahoo)
- **data** (main data for each timer)
- **submitted** (new timer submissions through the in-app form)

### Installation & Local Development

Download the repo and:

    $ npm install

You will need to add the MONGODB_URI secret with the Vercel CLI

    $ vercel secrets add MONGODB_URI [your mongo connection string]

Then run the following to start up development mode (default port is 3000):

    vercel dev
